Through this assignment, I was able to quickly create an informative read me
document. A new skill I learned through this process was double indented
lists, wherein asterisks versus dash lines spaced below the header line will
produce an indented list. This was interesting as I wasn't aware markdown was
sensitive to indentation/spaces. I also was able to recognize some variance in
syntax when the .md document was being rendered by the 'Markdown Preview
Enhanced' package versus online in git. Superscripts written as [ NORMAL WORD
^superscript^ ] will show up in Atom but not on Github. 

Through this assignment, I was also able to utilize atom's integrated git
features, wherein the 'Publish' button in the lower left of atom completes the
same operation as 'git push origin master'. The issue I found was an error in
the global user configuration on my local machine versus within atom. Once the
initial commit was pushed to github through the atom git package and the
global user login was configured, I was able to simply use 'git push' to
publish future commits. This assignment helped to refresh my knowledge of the
git change-tracking workflow between systems/machines/os.
